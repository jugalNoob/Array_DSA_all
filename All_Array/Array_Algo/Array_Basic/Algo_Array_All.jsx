üî• EXPERT-LEVEL ARRAY TECHNIQUES (Level 8-10+)
For competitive coding and top-tier interviews (FAANG, quant, etc.).

Mo's Algorithm

What: Efficiently answer range queries in an unsorted array.

Use Case: Offline query processing (e.g., "count distinct elements in subarrays").

Interview Tip: Rare but asked in hard problems (e.g., Google/DSA-heavy roles).

Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree) / Segment Tree

What: Dynamic range queries (sum/min/max) with updates in O(log n).

Use Case: Real-time analytics (e.g., stock price range tracking).

Interview Tip: Learn for optimizing prefix-sum problems with updates.

Sparse Table (Range Min/Max Query - RMQ)

What: Preprocess array for O(1) range min/max queries (static arrays).

Use Case: Genomics (finding min/max in DNA segments).

Interview Tip: Niche but powerful for static data.

Inversion Count (Merge Sort Variant)

What: Count pairs where i < j but arr[i] > arr[j].

Use Case: Measure dataset disorder (e.g., recommendation systems).

Interview Tip: Classic divide-and-conquer problem.

Interpolation Search

What: Improved binary search for uniformly distributed sorted arrays (O(log log n) avg).

Use Case: Searching in phonebooks, dictionaries.

üéØ TRICKY PROBLEM PATTERNS
Common twists in interviews:

Circular Array Problems

Example: Next Greater Element in a circular array.

Trick: Double the array or use mod to simulate circularity.

Non-Decreasing Array with One Change

What: Check if array can be made non-decreasing by modifying ‚â§1 element.

Trick: Greedy validation with edge cases.

First Missing Positive (Hard)

What: Find the smallest missing positive integer in unsorted array.

Rain Water Trapping

What: Calculate trapped water between bars.

Trick: Two-pointer or prefix/suffix max arrays.

‚ö° OPTIMIZATION TRICKS
How to impress interviewers:

Space Optimization

Reuse input array as output (e.g., arr[i] % n to store 2 values).

Example: "Rearrange array such that arr[arr[i]] becomes i."

Bitmasking with Arrays

Use Case: Subset generation, XOR tricks (e.g., "Find two unique numbers in array").

Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm

What: Find majority element in O(1) space.

Trick: Cancel out pairs of unequal elements.

Quickselect (k-th Smallest/Largest)

What: O(n) avg time (like quicksort but partial).

Trick: Pivot selection strategy matters.

Reservoir Sampling

What: Randomly select k items from a stream (unknown size).

Use Case: Random sampling in big data.

üí° PRO TIPS FOR INTERVIEWS
Clarify Constraints Early

Ask: "Can the array contain negatives/duplicates?"

Example: If array is sorted, binary search might apply.

Mention Time-Space Tradeoffs

"We can solve this in O(n) space with a hashmap, or O(n log n) time with sorting."

Practice Edge Cases

Empty array, single element, all identical elements, large inputs.

Draw It Out

Use whiteboard to visualize pointers/windows (e.g., sliding window).

Name the Pattern

"This is a variation of Kadane‚Äôs algorithm with a twist."
